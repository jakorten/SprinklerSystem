# SprinklerSystem
Repository for valve controllers etc.

Here I publish updates to Python and Arduino scripts to create my / your own irrigation system.

## System parts
CinqueValvoleHAT is used to control a pump system.
TinyRelayModule is used to control a larger (230V) relay to switch of the main pump.
DueValvoleZeroBoard is used to control two valves and also features sensors.

## Progress and links

June 2019:
- CinqueValvoleHAT: 5x Valve/Tap Controller board (v1.0 / v1.1) (https://github.com/jakorten/SprinklerSystem/tree/master/CinqueValvoleHAT)
- DueValvoleZeroBoard: 2x Valve/Tap under development, uses a SAMD21 microcontroller and interfaces with a Raspberry Pi Zero (W).
- TinyRelayModule is only a solderboard version for now.
